			<h6>Nobody	said	“astronaut.”	There	were	six	kids	at	the	family	gathering,	counting	the	cousins,	and	you	asked	each	one	of	them	the	conversation-starter	that’s	worked	for	generations.	Two	of	them	said	they	want	
	to	be	teachers	when	they	grow	up.	One	looked	up	from	her	tablet	and	just	said	“computers.”	Another	did	his	best	to	pronounce	“veterinarian.”	The	youngest	one	just	shrugged.	And	the	one	who	came	the	closest?	She	wants	to	design	cars	that	can	drive	themselves.	Had	she	only	added	“to	the	moon,”	you’d	have	called	it	a	win.
Driving the future. Three	hours	into	your	drive	home,	you’re	still	thinking	about	it.	Of	course,	you’re	not	in	a	flying	car,	nor	are	you	heading	for	your	space	colony.	But	still,	you	think	to	yourself,	have	our	dreams	been	grounded?	You	turn	up	the	music	and	keep	driving.
The	highway	gently	curves	as	you	start	to	climb	the	last	grade	before	the	city	limits.	Your	hand	only	lightly	grips	the	wheel.	Your	foot	is	merely	resting	on	the	gas	pedal.	You	feel	your	car	brake	as	a	motorhome	—	two	lanes	too	far	to	the	left	—	loses	its	momentum	in	your	path.	You	check	the	mirror,	tap	the	turn	signal	lever,	and	without	changing	your	grip	or	moving	your	feet,	your	E-Class	executes	a	move	with	the	charge	of	a	fullback	and	the	grace	of	a	ballerina.	Another	tap	and	you’re	back	in	the	third	lane,	back	at	your	cruising	speed,	and	suddenly,	in	your	mind,	back	at	the	kids’	dinner	table.
Maybe	you	didn’t	get	to	orbit	the	earth,	or	
	drive	on	the	moon.	That	said,	the	lunar	rover	
	didn’t	have	radar-based	cruise	control,	or	satellite	navigation.	No	voice	control,	no	climate	control,	and	surely	no	massaging	seats.	You	think	about	what	your	E-Class	can	do:	What	you’re	holding	in	your	hands	used	to	be	the	future.	But	some	engineers	with	wild	imaginations	turned	it	into	something	else:	the	present.	“I’m	sure,”	you	say	
	to	yourself,	“some	of	them	wanted	to	be	astronauts.”	And	here	you	are,	driving	their	
	“spaceship”	to	your	house.	Next	year	at	the	family	reunion,	you’re	taking	that	kid	for	a	drive.	No,	not	to	the	moon.	But	to	the	edge	of	the	future	she’ll	someday	reinvent.
