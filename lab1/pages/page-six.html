						<font color="white" face="sans-serif" size="3px">As	the	first	hint	of	morning	sunlight	pokes	through	your	bedroom	window,	something	
						feels	different.	Your	house	is	suddenly	on	full	auto-pilot:	The	coffee	is	freshly	ground	and	brewing	on	its	own.	Your	shower	is	prewarmed.	Your	clothes	hang	ready	for	your	
						day,	not	just	pressed	but	nicely	matched	without	any	effort	on	your	part.	In	a	few	minutes,	you’ll	summon	your	new	E-Class	by	voice,	and	it	will	greet	you	at	the	door	and	drive	you	to	work,	then	return	home	to	bring	the	kids	to	school.	It	all	seems	like	a	futuristic	dream.	And	as	your	alarm	wakes	you	up	for	real,	you	realize	it	is.	Or	is	it?

						Advancing the love of driving. Reality,	circa	2018,	is	not	too	far	off	from	your	dream.	Your	real-life	E	-Class	may	not	
						be	self-driving,	but	the	semi-autonomous	
						capabilities	it	does	offer	were	unheard-of	just	a	few	years	ago.	That	said,	if	it	actually	could	offer	to	auto-pilot	you	to	work	this	morning,	you’d	likely	say	“no,	thanks.”	You’d	much	rather	be	in	charge	of	its	turbocharged	surge,	paddle-shifting	through	all	
						nine	speeds	as	your	hands	grip	the	wheel	and	the	tires	grip	the	road.	The	symphony	of	it	all	is	what	drives	you	—	the	emotion	of	motion,	seamlessly	united,	with	you	at	the	center	of	it	all.	Behind	the	scenes,	Direct </font>

The	chassis	adapts	to	the	road,	with	selective	damping	that	firms	up	in	corners,	or	via	AIR	BODY	CONTROL*,	which	literally	turns	pressure	into	poise	around	curves	and	over	bumps.	<br><br>
					When	cars	can	fully	drive	themselves,	the	performance	advances	in	your	E-Class	will	help	make	the	ride	into	the	future	smooth	and	surefooted.	But	no	matter	how	it	motivates	the	progress	of	all	cars,	what	won’t	change	is	the	way	an	E-Class	inspires	you,	its	driver.	Not	just
